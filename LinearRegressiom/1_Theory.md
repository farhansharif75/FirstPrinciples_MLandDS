We will cover the theory behind the Linear Regression (LR) model first. The Wikipedia page for the LR model provides a suitable introduction to the mathematical formulation of this model.
Given a dataset of the form: $\left{y_{i}, x_{i1}, x_{i2}, \ldots, x_{ip}\right}$, LR models the relation between the $y_{i}$
